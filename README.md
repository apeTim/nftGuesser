# NFT GUESSER
Fun game for NFT enthusiasts. Guess NFT by its small piece!
[Live Demo](https://nftguesser.com) 

## Inspiration
We incredible love the NFT community. Every day new collections are born. But users cant forget those top tier collections like CryptoPunks, BAYC e.t.c. because they incredible changed the industry. And to help users fresh their memory and also see unique NFTs from the collections in a fun way -  the game was made.
## What it does
Our game shows the user a small 100x100 piece of a random NFT that belongs to a known list of collections. The user has to figure out to what collection shown piece belongs. 

For each right guess your streak increases. For a wrong guess, your streak goes to 0. Stay at the top of the streaks leaderboard to win cool prizes!
